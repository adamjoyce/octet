2D Terrain Generation using Fractional Brownian motion with Simplex noise:

I have included Andy Thomason's entire octet framework in the provided zip folder.

My project can be found under the following directory:

...\octet\src\examples\terrain_generator

The two classes that I wrote for this project can be found in the following two files:
- terrain_generator.h
- noise.h

I have include a write-up of the project in both .docx and .pdf format, as well as a link to a youtube
video demostration of the project.
